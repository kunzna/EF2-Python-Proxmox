A DateTime object's methods\nreturn values based on the timezone context.\n\nNote that in all cases the local machine timezone is used for\nrepresentation if no timezone is specified.\n\nConstructor for DateTime\n------------------------\n\nDateTime() returns a new date-time object.  DateTimes may be created\nwith from zero to seven arguments:\n\n* If the function is called with no arguments, then the current date/\n  time is returned, represented in the timezone of the local machine.\n\n* If the function is invoked with a single string argument which is a\n  recognized timezone name, an object representing the current time is\n  returned, represented in the specified timezone.\n\n* If the function is invoked with a single string argument\n  representing a valid date/time, an object representing that date/\n  time will be returned.\n\n  As a general rule, any date-time representation that is recognized\n  and unambiguous to a resident of North America is acceptable.  (The\n  reason for this qualification is that in North America, a date like:\n  2/1/1994 is interpreted as February 1, 1994, while in some parts of\n  the world, it is interpreted as January 2, 1994.) A date/ time\n  string consists of two components, a date component and an optional\n  time component, separated by one or more spaces.  If the time\n  component is omitted, 12:00am is assumed.\n  \n  Any recognized timezone name specified as the final element of the\n  date/time string will be used for computing the date/time value.\n  (If you create a DateTime with the string,\n  \"Mar 9, 1997 1:45pm US/Pacific\", the value will essentially be the\n  same as if you had captured time.time() at the specified date and\n  time on a machine in that timezone).  If no timezone is passed, then\n  the timezone configured on the local machine will be used, **except**\n  that if the date format matches ISO 8601 ('YYYY-MM-DD'), the instance\n  will use UTC / GMT+0 as the timezone.\n\n  o Returns current date/time, represented in US/Eastern:\n\n    >>> from DateTime import DateTime\n    >>> e = DateTime('US/Eastern')\n    >>> e.timezone()\n    'US/Eastern'\n\n  o Returns specified time, represented in local machine zone:\n\n    >>> x = DateTime('1997/3/9 1:45pm')\n    >>> x.parts() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\n    (1997, 3, 9, 13, 45, ...)\n\n  o Specified time in local machine zone, verbose format:\n\n    >>> y = DateTime('Mar 9, 1997 13:45:00')\n    >>> y.parts() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\n    (1997, 3, 9, 13, 45, ...)\n    >>> y == x\n    True\n    \n  o Specified time in UTC via ISO 8601 rule:\n  \n    >>> z = DateTime('2014-03-24')\n    >>> z.parts() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\n    (2014, 3, 24, 0, 0, ...)\n    >>> z.timezone()\n    'GMT+0'\n\n  The date component consists of year, month, and day values.  The\n  year value must be a one-, two-, or four-digit integer.  If a one-\n  or two-digit year is used, the year is assumed to be in the\n  twentieth century.  The month may an integer, from 1 to 12, a month\n  name, or a month abbreviation, where a period may optionally follow\n  the abbreviation.  The day must be an integer from 1 to the number of\n  days in the month.  The year, month, and day values may be separated\n  by periods, hyphens, forward slashes, or spaces.  Extra spaces are\n  permitted around the delimiters.  Year, month, and day values may be\n  given in any order as long as it is possible to distinguish the\n  components.  If all three components are numbers that are less than\n  13, then a month-day-year ordering is assumed.\n\n  The time component consists of hour, minute, and second values\n  separated by colons.  The hour value must be an integer between 0\n  and 23 inclusively.  The minute value must be an integer between 0\n  and 59 inclusively.  The second value may be an integer value\n  between 0 and 59.999 inclusively.  The second value or both the\n  minute and second values may be omitted.  The time may be followed\n  by am or pm in upper or lower case, in which case a 12-hour clock is\n  assumed.\n\n* If the DateTime function is invoked with a single numeric argument,\n  the number is assumed to be either a floating point value such as\n  that returned by time.time(), or a number of days after January 1,\n  1901 00:00:00 UTC.\n\n  A DateTime object is returned that represents either the GMT value\n  of the time.time() float represented in the local machine's\n  timezone, or that number of days after January 1, 1901.  Note that\n  the number of days after 1901 need to be expressed from the\n  viewpoint of the local machine's timezone.  A negative argument will\n  yield a date-time value before 1901.\n\n* If the function is invoked with two numeric arguments, then the\n  first is taken to be an integer year and the second argument is\n  taken to be an offset in days from the beginning of the year, in the\n  context of the local machine timezone.  The date-time value returned\n  is the given offset number of days from the beginning of the given\n  year, represented in the timezone of the local machine.  The offset\n  may be positive or negative.  Two-digit years are assumed to be in\n  the twentieth century.\n\n* If the function is invoked with two arguments, the first a float\n  representing a number of seconds past the epoch in GMT (such as\n  those returned by time.time()) and the second a string naming a\n  recognized timezone, a DateTime with a value of that GMT time will\n  be returned, represented in the given timezone.\n\n    >>> import time\n    >>> t = time.time()\n\n  Time t represented as US/Eastern:\n\n    >>> now_east = DateTime(t, 'US/Eastern')\n\n  Time t represented as US/Pacific:\n\n    >>> now_west = DateTime(t, 'US/Pacific')\n\n  Only their representations are different:\n\n    >>> now_east.equalTo(now_west)\n    True\n\n* If the function is invoked with three or more numeric arguments,\n  then the first is taken to be an integer year, the second is taken\n  to be an integer month, and the third is taken to be an integer day.\n  If the combination of values is not valid, then a DateTimeError is\n  raised.  One- or two-digit years up to 69 are assumed to be in the \n  21st century, whereas values 70-99 are assumed to be 20th century.\n  The fourth, fifth, and sixth arguments are floating point, positive\n  or negative offsets in units of hours, minutes, and days, and\n  default to zero if not given.  An optional string may be given as\n  the final argument to indicate timezone (the effect of this is as if\n  you had taken the value of time.time() at that time on a machine in\n  the specified timezone).\n\nIf a string argument passed to the DateTime constructor cannot be\nparsed, it will raise SyntaxError.  Invalid date, time, or\ntimezone components will raise a DateTimeError.\n\nThe module function Timezones() will return a list of the timezones\nrecognized by the DateTime module.  Recognition of timezone names is\ncase-insensitive.\n\nInstance Methods for DateTime (IDateTime interface)\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nConversion and comparison methods\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* ``timeTime()`` returns the date/time as a floating-point number in\n  UTC, in the format used by the Python time module.  Note that it is\n  possible to create date /time values with DateTime that have no\n  meaningful value to the time module, and in such cases a\n  DateTimeError is raised.  A DateTime object's value must generally\n  be between Jan 1, 1970 (or your local machine epoch) and Jan 2038 to\n  produce a valid time.time() style value.\n\n    >>> dt = DateTime('Mar 9, 1997 13:45:00 US/Eastern')\n    >>> dt.timeTime()\n    857933100.0\n\n    >>> DateTime('2040/01/01 UTC').timeTime()\n    2208988800.0\n\n    >>> DateTime('1900/01/01 UTC').timeTime()\n    -2208988800.0\n\n* ``toZone(z)`` returns a DateTime with the value as the current\n  object, represented in the indicated timezone:\n\n    >>> dt.toZone('UTC')\n    DateTime('1997/03/09 18:45:00 UTC')\n\n    >>> dt.toZone('UTC').equalTo(dt)\n    True\n\n* ``isFuture()`` returns true if this object represents a date/time\n  later than the time of the call:\n\n    >>> dt.isFuture()\n    False\n    >>> DateTime('Jan 1 3000').isFuture() # not time-machine safe!\n    True\n\n* ``isPast()`` returns true if this object represents a date/time\n  earlier than the time of the call:\n\n    >>> dt.isPast()\n    True\n    >>> DateTime('Jan 1 3000').isPast() # not time-machine safe!\n    False\n\n* ``isCurrentYear()`` returns true if this object represents a\n  date/time that falls within the current year, in the context of this\n  object's timezone representation:\n\n    >>> dt.isCurrentYear()\n    False\n    >>> DateTime().isCurrentYear()\n    True\n\n* ``isCurrentMonth()`` returns true if this object represents a\n  date/time that falls within the current month, in the context of\n  this object's timezone representation:\n\n    >>> dt.isCurrentMonth()\n    False\n    >>> DateTime().isCurrentMonth()\n    True\n\n* ``isCurrentDay()`` returns true if this object represents a\n  date/time that falls within the current day, in the context of this\n  object's timezone representation:\n\n    >>> dt.isCurrentDay()\n    False\n    >>> DateTime().isCurrentDay()\n    True\n\n* ``isCurrentHour()`` returns true if this object represents a\n  date/time that falls within the current hour, in the context of this\n  object's timezone representation:\n\n    >>> dt.isCurrentHour()\n    False\n\n    >>> DateTime().isCurrentHour()\n    True\n\n* ``isCurrentMinute()`` returns true if this object represents a\n  date/time that falls within the current minute, in the context of\n  this object's timezone representation:\n\n    >>> dt.isCurrentMinute()\n    False\n    >>> DateTime().isCurrentMinute()\n    True\n\n* ``isLeapYear()`` returns true if the current year (in the context of\n  the object's timezone) is a leap year:\n\n    >>> dt.isLeapYear()\n    False\n    >>> DateTime('Mar 8 2004').isLeapYear()\n    True\n\n* ``earliestTime()`` returns a new DateTime object that represents the\n    earliest possible time (in whole seconds) that still falls within\n    the current object's day, in the object's timezone context:\n\n    >>> dt.earliestTime()\n    DateTime('1997/03/09 00:00:00 US/Eastern')\n\n* ``latestTime()`` return a new DateTime object that represents the\n  latest possible time (in whole seconds) that still falls within the\n  current object's day, in the object's timezone context\n\n    >>> dt.latestTime()\n    DateTime('1997/03/09 23:59:59 US/Eastern')\n\nComponent access\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* ``parts()`` returns a tuple containing the calendar year, month,\n  day, hour, minute second and timezone of the object\n\n    >>> dt.parts() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\n    (1997, 3, 9, 13, 45, ...

DateTime instances pickled with\nformer versions of DateTime can be read, but older DateTime versions cannot read\nDateTime instances pickled with version 3.\n\nDateTime 3 changes DateTime to be a new-style class with slots instead of being\nan old-style class.\n\nDateTime 3 tries to preserve microsecond resolution throughout most of its API's\nwhile former versions were often only accurate to millisecond resolution. Due to\nthe representation of float values in Python versions before Python 2.7 you\nshouldn't compare string or float representations of DateTime instances if you\nwant high accuracy. The same is true for calculated values returned by methods\nlike `timeTime()`. You get the highest accuracy of comparing DateTime values by\ncalling its `micros()` methods. DateTime is not particular well suited to be\nused in comparing timestamps of file systems - use the time and datetime objects\nfrom the Python standard library instead.\n\n3.0b3 (2011-10-19)\n------------------\n\n- Allow comparison of DateTime objects against None.\n\n3.0b2 (2011-10-19)\n------------------\n\n- Reverted the single argument `None` special case handling for unpickling and\n  continue to treat it as meaning `now`.\n\n3.0b1 (2011-05-07)\n------------------\n\n- Restored `strftimeFormatter` as a class.\n\n- Added tests for read-only class attributes and interface.\n\n3.0a2 (2011-05-07)\n------------------\n\n- Added back support for reading old DateTime pickles without a `_micros` value.\n\n- Avoid storing `_t` representing the time as a float in seconds since the\n  epoch, as we already have `_micros` doing the same as a long. Memory use is\n  down to about 300 bytes per DateTime instance.\n\n- Updated exception raising syntax to current style.\n\n- Avoid storing `_aday`, `_fday`, `_pday`, `_amon`, `_fmon`, `_pmon`, `_pmhour`\n  and `_pm` in memory for every instance but look them up dynamically based on\n  `_dayoffset`, `_month` and `_hour`. This saves another 150 bytes of memory\n  per DateTime instance.\n\n- Moved various internal parsing related class variables to module constants.\n\n- No longer provide the `DateError`, `DateTimeError`, `SyntaxError` and\n  `TimeError` exceptions as class attributes, import them from their canonical\n  `DateTime.interfaces` location instead.\n\n- Removed deprecated `_isDST` and `_localzone` class variables.\n\n- Moved pytz cache from `DateTime._tzinfo` to a module global `_TZINFO`.\n\n- Make DateTime a new-style class and limit its available attributes via a\n  slots definition. The pickle size increases to 110 bytes thanks to the\n  `ccopy_reg\\n_reconstructor` stanza. But the memory size drops from 3kb to\n  500 bytes for each instance.\n\n3.0a1 (2011-05-06)\n------------------\n\n- Reordered some calculations in `_calcIndependentSecondEtc` to preserve more\n  floating point precision.\n\n- Optimized the pickled data, by only storing a tuple of `_micros` and time\n  zone information - this reduces the pickle size from an average of 300 bytes\n  to just 60 bytes.\n\n- Optimized un-pickling, by avoiding the creation of an intermediate DateTime\n  value representing the current time.\n\n- Removed in-place migration of old DateTime pickles without a `_micros` value.\n\n- Removed deprecated support for using `DateTime.__cmp__`.\n\n- Take time zone settings into account when comparing two date times for\n  (non-) equality.\n\n- Fixed (possibly unused) _parse_iso8601 function.\n\n- Removed unused import of legacy DateTimeZone, strftime and re.\n  Remove trailing whitespace.\n\n- Removed reference to missing version section from buildout.\n\n2.12.7 (2012-08-11)\n-------------------\n\n- Added forward compatibility with DateTime 3 pickle format. DateTime\n  instances constructed under version 3 can be read and unpickled by this\n  version. The pickled data is converted to the current versions format\n  (old-style class / no slots). Once converted it will be stored again in the\n  old format. This should allow for a transparent upgrade/downgrade path\n  between DateTime 2 and 3.\n\n2.12.6 (2010-10-17)\n-------------------\n\n- Changed ``testDayOfWeek`` test to be independent of OS locale.\n\n2.12.5 (2010-07-29)\n-------------------\n\n- Launchpad #143269: Corrected the documentation for year value\n  behavior when constructing a DateTime object with three numeric\n  arguments.\n\n- Launchpad #142521: Removed confusing special case in\n  DateTime.__str__ where DateTime instances for midnight\n  (e.g. '2010-07-27 00:00:00 US/Eastern') values would\n  render only their date and nothing else.\n\n2.12.4 (2010-07-12)\n-------------------\n\n- Fixed mapping of EDT (was -> 'GMT-0400', now 'GMT-4').\n\n2.12.3 (2010-07-09)\n-------------------\n\n- Added EDT timezone support. Addresses bug #599856.\n  [vangheem]\n\n2.12.2 (2010-05-05)\n-------------------\n\n- Launchpad #572715:  Relaxed pin on pytz, after applying a patch from\n  Marius Gedminus which fixes the apparent API breakage.\n\n2.12.1 (2010-04-30)\n-------------------\n\n- Removed an undeclared testing dependency on zope.testing.doctest in favor of\n  the standard libraries doctest module.\n\n- Added a maximum version requirement on pytz <= 2010b. Later versions produce\n  test failures related to timezone changes.\n\n2.12.0 (2009-03-04)\n-------------------\n\n- Launchpad #290254: Forward-ported fix for '_micros'-less pickles from\n  the Zope 2.11 branch version.\n\n2.11.2 (2009-02-02)\n-------------------\n\n- Include *all* pytz zone names, not just \"common\" ones.\n\n- Fix one fragile doctest, band-aid another.\n\n- Fix for launchpad #267545: DateTime(DateTime()) should preserve the\n  correct hour.\n\n2.11.1 (2008-08-05)\n-------------------\n\n- DateTime conversion of datetime objects with non-pytz tzinfo. Timezones()\n  returns a copy of the timezone list (allows tests to run).\n\n- Merged the slinkp-datetime-200007 branch: fix the DateTime(anotherDateTime)\n  constructor to preserve timezones.\n\n2.11.0b1 (2008-01-06)\n---------------------\n\n- Split off from the Zope2 main source code tree.\n"

        "description": "pytz - World Timezone Definitions for Python\n============================================\n\n:Author: Stuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n\nIntroduction\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\npytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows\naccurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4\nor higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end\nof daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python\nLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).\n\nAlmost all of the Olson timezones are supported.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support\n    now included as part of the standard library, and third party\n    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n    pytz offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with\n    code written for earlier versions of Python.\n\n.. note::\n\n    This library differs from the documented Python API for\n    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock\n    times you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this\n    document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local\n    times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect\n    timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get\n    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A\n    ``normalize()`` method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these\n    issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime\n    implementation (see PEP-431).\n\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using the\nstandard Python distutils.\n\nIf you are installing using ``pip``, you don't need to download anything as the\nlatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::\n\n    pip install pytz\n\nIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command as an\nadministrative user::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\npytz for Enterprise\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThe maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.\n\n\nExample & Usage\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLocalized times and date arithmetic\n-----------------------------------\n\n>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n>>> from pytz import timezone\n>>> import pytz\n>>> utc = pytz.utc\n>>> utc.zone\n'UTC'\n>>> eastern = timezone('US/Eastern')\n>>> eastern.zone\n'US/Eastern'\n>>> amsterdam = timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')\n>>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z'\n\nThis library only supports two ways of building a localized time. The\nfirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by the pytz library.\nThis is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with no timezone\ninformation):\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0))\n>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500\n\nThe second way of building a localized time is by converting an existing\nlocalized time using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:\n\n>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)\n>>> ams_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100'\n\nUnfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime\nconstructors ''does not work'' with pytz for many timezones.\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Does not work this way!\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018'\n\nIt is safe for timezones without daylight saving transitions though, such\nas UTC:\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Not recommended except for UTC\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000'\n\nThe preferred way of dealing with times is to always work in UTC,\nconverting to localtime only when generating output to be read\nby humans.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:00:00 EST-0500'\n\nThis library also allows you to do date arithmetic using local\ntimes, although it is more complicated than working in UTC as you\nneed to use the ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving time\nand other timezone transitions. In this example, ``loc_dt`` is set\nto the instant when daylight saving time ends in the US/Eastern\ntimezone.\n\n>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)\n>>> before.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500'\n>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:50:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))\n>>> after.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500'\n\nCreating local times is also tricky, and the reason why working with\nlocal times is not recommended. Unfortunately, you cannot just pass\na ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing a datetime (see the next\nsection for more details)\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 0)\n>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nConverting between timezones is more easily done, using the\nstandard astimezone method.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2\nTrue\n\nYou can take shortcuts when dealing with the UTC side of timezone\nconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()`` are not really\nnecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions to\ndeal with.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n\n\n``tzinfo`` API\n--------------\n\nThe ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function have\nbeen extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``\nparameter to the ``utcoffset()``, ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.\n\n>>> tz = timezone('America/St_Johns')\n\n>>> normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)\n>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)\n\nThe ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only used\nduring DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds\n3600\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 20:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\ndatetime.timedelta(0)\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\n'NST'\n\nIf ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raise\nan ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError`` exception.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> import pytz.exceptions\n>>> try:\n...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.dst(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.tzname(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n\n\nProblems with Localtime\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe major problem we have to deal with is that certain datetimes\nmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern timezone\non the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequence\nhappens:\n\n    - 01:00 EDT occurs\n    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned back 1 hour\n      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)\n\nIn fact, every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This means\nthat if you try and create a time in the 'US/Eastern' timezone\nthe standard datetime syntax, there is no way to specify if you meant\nbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time transition. Using the\npytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated guess:\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nAs you can see, the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50%\nchance of it being out by one hour. For some applications, this does\nnot matter. However, if you are trying to schedule meetings with people\nin different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable.\n\nThe best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The pytz\npackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by\nincluding a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python\nreference implementation in the Python documentation.\n\nThe UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance, and pickles to a\nsmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementation\ncan be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone('UTC').\n\n>>> import pickle, pytz\n>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)\n>>> p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)\n>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)\n>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)\n17\n>>> new = pickle.loads(p)\n>>> new == dt\nTrue\n>>> new is dt\nFalse\n>>> new.tzinfo is dt.tzinfo\nTrue\n>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone('UTC')\nTrue\n\nNote that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,\nGreenwich, Universal, etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from these\nother timezones, and they are not equivalent. For this reason, they will\nnot compare the same in Python.\n\n>>> utc == pytz.timezone('GMT')\nFalse\n\nSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.\n\nIf you insist on working with local times, this library provides a\nfacility for constructing them unambiguously:\n\n>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + ' / ' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500\n\nIf you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize(), pytz will refuse to\nguess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent\ntimes.\n\nFor example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US/Eastern\ntimezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving\nTime:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00\n\nSimilarly, 2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the\nUS/Eastern timezone, as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skipping\nthe entire hour:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00\n\nBoth of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling\neasier:\n\n>>> isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n\n\nA special case is where countries change their timezone definitions\nwith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsaw\nswitched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings\ntransition. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks\nwere wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot\nbe specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the\nactual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither time\nduring a daylight saving time period. pytz handles this transition by\ntreating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings\ntime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.\n\n\n>>> warsaw = pytz.timezone('Europe/Warsaw')\n>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)\n>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 WMT+0124'\n>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=False)\n>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100'\n>>> switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)\n>>> switch_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt1)\n'0:24:01'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)\n'0:00:01'\n\nThe best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is\nby converting from another timezone such as UTC:\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)\n>>> utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100'\n\nThe standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to\nhandle them, such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Eastern\ntimezone definition from the Python documentation (Note that this\nimplementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is\nincluded for tests only!):\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)\n>>> str(dt)\n'2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=1))\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))\n'2002-10-27 02:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))\n'2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00'\n\nNotice the first two results? At first glance you might think they are\ncorrect, but taking the UTC offset into account you find that they are\nactually two hours appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import UTC # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00'\n>>> str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00'\n\n\nCountry Information\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA mechanism is provided to access the timezones commonly in use\nfor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country code.\nIt returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevant\ntzinfo instance using ``pytz.timezone()``:\n\n>>> print(' '.join(pytz.country_timezones['nz']))\nPacific/Auckland Pacific/Chatham\n\nThe Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English country\nname mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:\n\n>>> print(pytz.country_names['nz'])\nNew Zealand\n\n\nWhat is UTC\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n'UTC' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It is a successor to, but distinct\nfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various definitions of Universal\nTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating clocks and time\nmeasurement.\n\nAll other timezones are defined relative to UTC, and include offsets like\nUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive the local time. No\ndaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone to perform\ndate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities caused\nby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone, or\nmobile computers that roam through multiple timezones.\n\n..  _Coordinated Universal Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\n\n\nHelpers\n~~~~~~~\n\nThere are two lists of timezones provided.\n\n``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list of the timezone names that can\nbe used.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones\n>>> len(all_timezones) >= 500\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in all_timezones\nTrue\n\n``common_timezones`` is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn't\ncontain deprecated zones or historical zones, except for a few I've\ndeemed in common usage, such as US/Eastern (open a bug report if you\nthink other timezones are deserving of being included here). It is also\na sequence of strings.\n\n>>> from pytz import common_timezones\n>>> len(common_timezones) < len(all_timezones)\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in common_timezones\nFalse\n>>> 'Australia/Melbourne' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Canada/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in all_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in common_timezones\nFalse\n\nBoth ``common_timezones`` and ``all_timezones`` are alphabetically\nsorted:\n\n>>> common_timezones_dupe = common_timezones[:]\n>>> common_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> common_timezones == common_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n>>> all_timezones_dupe = all_timezones[:]\n>>> all_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> all_timezones == all_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n\n``all_timezones`` and ``common_timezones`` are also available as sets.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones_set, common_timezones_set\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in all_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Victoria' in common_timezones_set\nFalse\n\nYou can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countries\nusing the ``country_timezones()`` function. It requires an ISO-3166\ntwo letter country code.\n\n>>> from pytz import country_timezones\n>>> print(' '.join(country_timezones('ch')))\nEurope/Zurich\n>>> print(' '.join(country_timezones('CH')))\nEurope/Zurich\n\n\nInternationalization - i18n/l10n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPytz is an interface to the IANA database, which uses ASCII names. The `Unicode  Consortium's Unicode Locales (CLDR) <http://cldr.unicode.org>`_\nproject provides translations. Python packages such as\n`Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html#timezone-functionality>`_\nand Thomas Khyn's `l18n <https://pypi.org/project/l18n/>`_ package can be used\nto access these translations from Python.\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nMIT license.\n\nThis code is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope Public\nLicense,  Version 2.1 (ZPL).\n\nI'm happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in other\nopen source projects.\n\n\nLatest Versions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package will be updated after releases of the Olson timezone\ndatabase.  The latest version can be downloaded from the `Python Package\nIndex <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_.  The code that is used\nto generate this distribution is hosted on Github and available\nusing git::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/stub42/pytz.git\n\nAnnouncements of new releases are made on\n`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/pytz>`_, and the\n`Atom feed <http://feeds.launchpad.net/pytz/announcements.atom>`_\nhosted there.\n\n\nBugs, Feature Requests & Patches\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBugs should be reported on `Github <https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues>`_.\nFeature requests are unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directed\nto timezone support now built into Python or packages that work with it.\n\n\nSecurity Issues\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReports about security issues can be made via `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.\n\n\nIssues & Limitations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- This project is in maintenance mode. Projects using Python 3.9 or later\n  are best served by using the timezone functionaly now included in core\n  Python and packages that work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n\n- Offsets from UTC are rounded to the nearest whole minute, so timezones\n  such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will be up to 30 seconds out. This\n  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.\n\n- If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can't fix\n  it. pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and\n  changes to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.\n  If you find errors they should be reported to the time zone mailing\n  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMore info than you want to know about timezones:\nhttps://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html\n\n\nContact\n~~~~~~~\n\nStuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n"

It is maintained by the `Zope Toolkit project\n<https://zopetoolkit.readthedocs.io/>`_.\n\nThis package provides an implementation of \"object interfaces\" for Python.\nInterfaces are a mechanism for labeling objects as conforming to a given\nAPI or contract. So, this package can be considered as implementation of\nthe `Design By Contract`_ methodology support in Python.\n\n.. _Design By Contract: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract\n\nFor detailed documentation, please see https://zopeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n=========\n Changes\n=========\n\n8.0.1 (2025-09-25)\n==================\n\n- Make tests resilient against different ways of calling them.\n\n- Remove run-time dependency on ``setuptools``.\n\n\n8.0 (2025-09-12)\n================\n\n- Replace ``pkg_resources`` namespace with PEP 420 native namespace.\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.8.\n\n- Allow using newer ``setuptools`` version.\n  (`#333 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/333>`_)\n\n\n7.2 (2024-11-28)\n================\n\n- Add preliminary support for Python 3.14a2, this means that\n  ``.common.builtins.IByteString`` and ``.common.collections.IByteString`` are\n  no longer available from this Python version onwards as Python 3.14 dropped\n  ``collections.abc.ByteString``.\n\n\n7.1.1 (2024-10-23)\n==================\n\n- Fix segmentation faults in `weakrefobject.c` on Python 3.12 and 3.13.\n  (`#323 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/323>`_)\n\n\n7.1.0 (2024-10-10)\n==================\n\n- Declare support for Python 3.13.\n\n- Fix segmentation faults on Python 3.13.\n  (`#323 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/323>`_)\n\n\n7.0.3 (2024-08-27)\n==================\n\n- Fix `Assertion 'memb->type == T_PYSSIZET' failed.` for Python < 3.12.\n  (`#319 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/319>`_)\n\n\n7.0.2 (2024-08-26)\n==================\n\n- Fix reference-counting bug in C module initialization (broken in 7.0).\n  (`#316 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/316>`_)\n\n\n7.0.1 (2024-08-06)\n==================\n\n- Fix subclassability of ``ObjectSpecificationDescriptor`` (broken in 7.0).\n  (`#312 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/312>`_)\n\n\n7.0 (2024-08-06)\n================\n\n- Enable heap-based types (PEP 384) for Python >= 3.11.\n\n- Adopt multi-phase module initialization (PEP 489).\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.7.\n\n\n6.4.post2 (2024-05-24)\n======================\n\n- Publish missing Windows wheels, second attempt.\n  (`#295 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/295>`_)\n\n\n6.4.post1 (2024-05-23)\n======================\n\n- Publish missing Windows wheels.\n  (`#295 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/295>`_)\n\n\n6.4.post0 (2024-05-22)\n======================\n\n- The sdist of version 6.4 was uploaded to PyPI as\n  ``zope_interface-6.4.tar.gz`` instead of ``zope.interface-6.4-py2.tar.gz``\n  which cannot be installed by ``zc.buildout``.  This release is a re-release\n  of version 6.4 with the correct sdist name.\n  (`#298 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/298>`_)\n\n\n6.4 (2024-05-15)\n================\n\n- Adjust for incompatible changes in Python 3.13b1.\n  (`#292 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/292>`_)\n\n- Build windows wheels on GHA.\n\n6.3 (2024-04-12)\n================\n\n- Add preliminary support for Python 3.13 as of 3.13a6.\n\n\n6.2 (2024-02-16)\n================\n\n- Add preliminary support for Python 3.13 as of 3.13a3.\n\n- Add support to use the pipe (``|``) syntax for ``typing.Union``.\n  (`#280 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/280>`_)\n\n\n6.1 (2023-10-05)\n================\n\n- Build Linux binary wheels for Python 3.12.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.12.\n\n- Fix building of the docs for non-final versions.\n\n\n6.0 (2023-03-17)\n================\n\n- Build Linux binary wheels for Python 3.11.\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.\n\n- Fix test deprecation warning on Python 3.11.\n\n- Add preliminary support for Python 3.12 as of 3.12a5.\n\n- Drop:\n\n    + `zope.interface.implements`\n    + `zope.interface.implementsOnly`\n    + `zope.interface.classProvides`\n\n\n5.5.2 (2022-11-17)\n==================\n\n- Add support for building arm64 wheels on macOS.\n\n\n5.5.1 (2022-11-03)\n==================\n\n- Add support for final Python 3.11 release.\n\n\n5.5.0 (2022-10-10)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.10 and 3.11 (as of 3.11.0rc2).\n\n- Add missing Trove classifier showing support for Python 3.9.\n\n- Add some more entries to ``zope.interface.interfaces.__all__``.\n\n- Disable unsafe math optimizations in C code.  See `pull request 262\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/262>`_.\n\n\n5.4.0 (2021-04-15)\n==================\n\n- Make the C implementation of the ``__providedBy__`` descriptor stop\n  ignoring all errors raised when accessing the instance's\n  ``__provides__``. Now it behaves like the Python version and only\n  catches ``AttributeError``. The previous behaviour could lead to\n  crashing the interpreter in cases of recursion and errors. See\n  `issue 239 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues>`_.\n\n- Update the ``repr()`` and ``str()`` of various objects to be shorter\n  and more informative. In many cases, the ``repr()`` is now something\n  that can be evaluated to produce an equal object. For example, what\n  was previously printed as ``<implementedBy builtins.list>`` is now\n  shown as ``classImplements(list, IMutableSequence, IIterable)``. See\n  `issue 236 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/236>`_.\n\n- Make ``Declaration.__add__`` (as in ``implementedBy(Cls) +\n  ISomething``) try harder to preserve a consistent resolution order\n  when the two arguments share overlapping pieces of the interface\n  inheritance hierarchy. Previously, the right hand side was always\n  put at the end of the resolution order, which could easily produce\n  invalid orders. See `issue 193\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/193>`_.\n\n5.3.0 (2020-03-21)\n==================\n\n- No changes from 5.3.0a1\n\n\n5.3.0a1 (2021-03-18)\n====================\n\n- Improve the repr of ``zope.interface.Provides`` to remove ambiguity\n  about what is being provided. This is especially helpful diagnosing\n  IRO issues.\n\n- Allow subclasses of ``BaseAdapterRegistry`` (including\n  ``AdapterRegistry`` and ``VerifyingAdapterRegistry``) to have\n  control over the data structures. This allows persistent\n  implementations such as those based on ZODB to choose more scalable\n  options (e.g., BTrees instead of dicts). See `issue 224\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/224>`_.\n\n- Fix a reference counting issue in ``BaseAdapterRegistry`` that could\n  lead to references to interfaces being kept around even when all\n  utilities/adapters/subscribers providing that interface have been\n  removed. This is mostly an issue for persistent implementations.\n  Note that this only corrects the issue moving forward, it does not\n  solve any already corrupted reference counts. See `issue 227\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/227>`_.\n\n- Add the method ``BaseAdapterRegistry.rebuild()``. This can be used\n  to fix the reference counting issue mentioned above, as well as to\n  update the data structures when custom data types have changed.\n\n- Add the interface method ``IAdapterRegistry.subscribed()`` and\n  implementation ``BaseAdapterRegistry.subscribed()`` for querying\n  directly registered subscribers. See `issue 230\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/230>`_.\n\n- Add the maintenance method\n  ``Components.rebuildUtilityRegistryFromLocalCache()``. Most users\n  will not need this, but it can be useful if the ``Components.utilities``\n  registry is suspected to be out of sync with the ``Components``\n  object itself (this might happen to persistent ``Components``\n  implementations in the face of bugs).\n\n- Fix the ``Provides`` and ``ClassProvides`` descriptors to stop\n  allowing redundant interfaces (those already implemented by the\n  underlying class or meta class) to produce an inconsistent\n  resolution order. This is similar to the change in ``@implementer``\n  in 5.1.0, and resolves inconsistent resolution orders with\n  ``zope.proxy`` and ``zope.location``. See `issue 207\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/207>`_.\n\n5.2.0 (2020-11-05)\n==================\n\n- Add documentation section ``Persistency and Equality``\n  (`#218 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/218>`_).\n\n- Create arm64 wheels.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.9.\n\n\n5.1.2 (2020-10-01)\n==================\n\n- Make sure to call each invariant only once when validating invariants.\n  Previously, invariants could be called multiple times because when an\n  invariant is defined in an interface, it's found by in all interfaces\n  inheriting from that interface.  See `pull request 215\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/215/>`_.\n\n5.1.1 (2020-09-30)\n==================\n\n- Fix the method definitions of ``IAdapterRegistry.subscribe``,\n  ``subscriptions`` and ``subscribers``. Previously, they all were\n  defined to accept a ``name`` keyword argument, but subscribers have\n  no names and the implementation of that interface did not accept\n  that argument. See `issue 208\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/208>`_.\n\n- Fix a potential reference leak in the C optimizations. Previously,\n  applications that dynamically created unique ``Specification``\n  objects (e.g., used ``@implementer`` on dynamic classes) could\n  notice a growth of small objects over time leading to increased\n  garbage collection times. See `issue 216\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/216>`_.\n\n  .. caution::\n\n     This leak could prevent interfaces used as the bases of\n     other interfaces from being garbage collected. Those interfaces\n     will now be collected.\n\n     One way in which this would manifest was that ``weakref.ref``\n     objects (and things built upon them, like\n     ``Weak[Key|Value]Dictionary``) would continue to have access to\n     the original object even if there were no other visible\n     references to Python and the original object *should* have been\n     collected. This could be especially problematic for the\n     ``WeakKeyDictionary`` when combined with dynamic or local\n     (created in the scope of a function) interfaces, since interfaces\n     are hashed based just on their name and module name. See the\n     linked issue for an example of a resulting ``KeyError``.\n\n     Note that such potential errors are not new, they are just once\n     again a possibility.\n\n5.1.0 (2020-04-08)\n==================\n\n- Make ``@implementer(*iface)`` and ``classImplements(cls, *iface)``\n  ignore redundant interfaces. If the class already implements an\n  interface through inheritance, it is no longer redeclared\n  specifically for *cls*. This solves many instances of inconsistent\n  resolution orders, while still allowing the interface to be declared\n  for readability and maintenance purposes. See `issue 199\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/199>`_.\n\n- Remove all bare ``except:`` statements. Previously, when accessing\n  special attributes such as ``__provides__``, ``__providedBy__``,\n  ``__class__`` and ``__conform__``, this package wrapped such access\n  in a bare ``except:`` statement, meaning that many errors could pass\n  silently; typically this would result in a fallback path being taken\n  and sometimes (like with ``providedBy()``) the result would be\n  non-sensical. This is especially true when those attributes are\n  implemented with descriptors. Now, only ``AttributeError`` is\n  caught. This makes errors more obvious.\n\n  Obviously, this means that some exceptions will be propagated\n  differently than before. In particular, ``RuntimeError`` raised by\n  Acquisition in the case of circular containment will now be\n  propagated. Previously, when adapting such a broken object, a\n  ``TypeError`` would be the common result, but now it will be a more\n  informative ``RuntimeError``.\n\n  In addition, ZODB errors like ``POSKeyError`` could now be\n  propagated where previously they would ignored by this package.\n\n  See `issue 200 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/200>`_.\n\n- Require that the second argument (*bases*) to ``InterfaceClass`` is\n  a tuple. This only matters when directly using ``InterfaceClass`` to\n  create new interfaces dynamically. Previously, an individual\n  interface was allowed, but did not work correctly. Now it is\n  consistent with ``type`` and requires a tuple.\n\n- Let interfaces define custom ``__adapt__`` methods. This implements\n  the other side of the :pep:`246` adaptation protocol: objects being\n  adapted could already implement ``__conform__`` if they know about\n  the interface, and now interfaces can implement ``__adapt__`` if\n  they know about particular objects. There is no performance penalty\n  for interfaces that do not supply custom ``__adapt__`` methods.\n\n  This includes the ability to add new methods, or override existing\n  interface methods using the new ``@interfacemethod`` decorator.\n\n  See `issue 3 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/3>`_.\n\n- Make the internal singleton object returned by APIs like\n  ``implementedBy`` and ``directlyProvidedBy`` for objects that\n  implement or provide no interfaces more immutable. Previously an\n  internal cache could be mutated. See `issue 204\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/204>`_.\n\n5.0.2 (2020-03-30)\n==================\n\n- Ensure that objects that implement no interfaces (such as direct\n  subclasses of ``object``) still include ``Interface`` itself in\n  their ``__iro___`` and ``__sro___``. This fixes adapter registry\n  lookups for such objects when the adapter is registered for\n  ``Interface``. See `issue 197\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/197>`_.\n\n\n5.0.1 (2020-03-21)\n==================\n\n- Ensure the resolution order for ``InterfaceClass`` is consistent.\n  See `issue 192 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/192>`_.\n\n- Ensure the resolution order for ``collections.OrderedDict`` is\n  consistent on CPython 2. (It was already consistent on Python 3 and PyPy).\n\n- Fix the handling of the ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_IRO`` environment\n  variable. Previously, ``ZOPE_INTERFACE_STRICT_RO`` was read, in\n  contrast with the documentation. See `issue 194\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/194>`_.\n\n\n5.0.0 (2020-03-19)\n==================\n\n- Make an internal singleton object returned by APIs like\n  ``implementedBy`` and ``directlyProvidedBy`` immutable. Previously,\n  it was fully mutable and allowed changing its ``__bases___``. That\n  could potentially lead to wrong results in pathological corner\n  cases. See `issue 158\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/158>`_.\n\n- Support the ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable at runtime instead\n  of just at wheel build time. A value of 0 forces the C extensions to\n  be used (even on PyPy) failing if they aren't present. Any other\n  value forces the Python implementation to be used, ignoring the C\n  extensions. See `PR 151 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/151>`_.\n\n- Cache the result of ``__hash__`` method in ``InterfaceClass`` as a\n  speed optimization. The method is called very often (i.e several\n  hundred thousand times during Plone 5.2 startup). Because the hash value never\n  changes it can be cached. This improves test performance from 0.614s\n  down to 0.575s (1.07x faster). In a real world Plone case a reindex\n  index came down from 402s to 320s (1.26x faster). See `PR 156\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/156>`_.\n\n- Change the C classes ``SpecificationBase`` and its subclass\n  ``ClassProvidesBase`` to store implementation attributes in their structures\n  instead of their instance dictionaries. This eliminates the use of\n  an undocumented private C API function, and helps make some\n  instances require less memory. See `PR 154 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/154>`_.\n\n- Reduce memory usage in other ways based on observations of usage\n  patterns in Zope (3) and Plone code bases.\n\n  - Specifications with no dependents are common (more than 50%) so\n    avoid allocating a ``WeakKeyDictionary`` unless we need it.\n  - Likewise, tagged values are relatively rare, so don't allocate a\n    dictionary to hold them until they are used.\n  - Use ``__slots___`` or the C equivalent ``tp_members`` in more\n    common places. Note that this removes the ability to set arbitrary\n    instance variables on certain objects.\n    See `PR 155 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/155>`_.\n\n  The changes in this release resulted in a 7% memory reduction after\n  loading about 6,000 modules that define about 2,200 interfaces.\n\n  .. caution::\n\n     Details of many private attributes have changed, and external use\n     of those private attributes may break. In particular, the\n     lifetime and default value of ``_v_attrs`` has changed.\n\n- Remove support for hashing uninitialized interfaces. This could only\n  be done by subclassing ``InterfaceClass``. This has generated a\n  warning since it was first added in 2011 (3.6.5). Please call the\n  ``InterfaceClass`` constructor or otherwise set the appropriate\n  fields in your subclass before attempting to hash or sort it. See\n  `issue 157 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/157>`_.\n\n- Remove unneeded override of the ``__hash__`` method from\n  ``zope.interface.declarations.Implements``. Watching a reindex index\n  process in ZCatalog with on a Py-Spy after 10k samples the time for\n  ``.adapter._lookup`` was reduced from 27.5s to 18.8s (~1.5x faster).\n  Overall reindex index time shrunk from 369s to 293s (1.26x faster).\n  See `PR 161\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/161>`_.\n\n- Make the Python implementation closer to the C implementation by\n  ignoring all exceptions, not just ``AttributeError``, during (parts\n  of) interface adaptation. See `issue 163\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/163>`_.\n\n- Micro-optimization in ``.adapter._lookup`` , ``.adapter._lookupAll``\n  and ``.adapter._subscriptions``: By loading ``components.get`` into\n  a local variable before entering the loop a bytcode \"LOAD_FAST 0\n  (components)\" in the loop can be eliminated. In Plone, while running\n  all tests, average speedup of the \"owntime\" of ``_lookup`` is ~5x.\n  See `PR 167\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/167>`_.\n\n- Add ``__all__`` declarations to all modules. This helps tools that\n  do auto-completion and documentation and results in less cluttered\n  results. Wildcard (\"*\") are not recommended and may be affected. See\n  `issue 153\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/153>`_.\n\n- Fix ``verifyClass`` and ``verifyObject`` for builtin types like\n  ``dict`` that have methods taking an optional, unnamed argument with\n  no default value like ``dict.pop``. On PyPy3, the verification is\n  strict, but on PyPy2 (as on all versions of CPython) those methods\n  cannot be verified and are ignored. See `issue 118\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/118>`_.\n\n- Update the common interfaces ``IEnumerableMapping``,\n  ``IExtendedReadMapping``, ``IExtendedWriteMapping``,\n  ``IReadSequence`` and ``IUniqueMemberWriteSequence`` to no longer\n  require methods that were removed from Python 3 on Python 3, such as\n  ``__setslice___``. Now, ``dict``, ``list`` and ``tuple`` properly\n  verify as ``IFullMapping``, ``ISequence`` and ``IReadSequence,``\n  respectively on all versions of Python.\n\n- Add human-readable ``__str___`` and ``__repr___`` to ``Attribute``\n  and ``Method``. These contain the name of the defining interface\n  and the attribute. For methods, it also includes the signature.\n\n- Change the error strings raised by ``verifyObject`` and\n  ``verifyClass``. They now include more human-readable information\n  and exclude extraneous lines and spaces. See `issue 170\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/170>`_.\n\n  .. caution:: This will break consumers (such as doctests) that\n               depended on the exact error messages.\n\n- Make ``verifyObject`` and ``verifyClass`` report all errors, if the\n  candidate object has multiple detectable violations. Previously they\n  reported only the first error. See `issue\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/171>`_.\n\n  Like the above, this will break consumers depending on the exact\n  output of error messages if more than one error is present.\n\n- Add ``zope.interface.common.collections``,\n  ``zope.interface.common.numbers``, and ``zope.interface.common.io``.\n  These modules define interfaces based on the ABCs defined in the\n  standard library ``collections.abc``, ``numbers`` and ``io``\n  modules, respectively. Importing these modules will make the\n  standard library concrete classes that are registered with those\n  ABCs declare the appropriate interface. See `issue 138\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/138>`_.\n\n- Add ``zope.interface.common.builtins``. This module defines\n  interfaces of common builtin types, such as ``ITextString`` and\n  ``IByteString``, ``IDict``, etc. These interfaces extend the\n  appropriate interfaces from ``collections`` and ``numbers``, and the\n  standard library classes implement them after importing this module.\n  This is intended as a replacement for third-party packages like\n  `dolmen.builtins <https://pypi.org/project/dolmen.builtins/>`_.\n  See `issue 138 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/138>`_.\n\n- Make ``providedBy()`` and ``implementedBy()`` respect ``super``\n  objects. For instance, if class ``Derived`` implements ``IDerived``\n  and extends ``Base`` which in turn implements ``IBase``, then\n  ``providedBy(super(Derived, derived))`` will return ``[IBase]``.\n  Previously it would have returned ``[IDerived]`` (in general, it\n  would previously have returned whatever would have been returned\n  without ``super``).\n\n  Along with this change, adapter registries will unpack ``super``\n  objects into their ``__self___`` before passing it to the factory.\n  Together, this means that ``component.getAdapter(super(Derived,\n  self), ITarget)`` is now meaningful.\n\n  See `issue 11 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/11>`_.\n\n- Fix a potential interpreter crash in the low-level adapter\n  registry lookup functions. See issue 11.\n\n- Adopt Python's standard `C3 resolution order\n  <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/>`_ to compute the\n  ``__iro__`` and ``__sro__`` of interfaces, with tweaks to support\n  additional cases that are common in interfaces but disallowed for\n  Python classes. Previously, an ad-hoc ordering that made no\n  particular guarantees was used.\n\n  This has many beneficial properties, including the fact that base\n  interface and base classes tend to appear near the end of the\n  resolution order instead of the beginning. The resolution order in\n  general should be more predictable and consistent.\n\n  .. caution::\n     In some cases, especially with complex interface inheritance\n     trees or when manually providing or implementing interfaces, the\n     resulting IRO may be quite different. This may affect adapter\n     lookup.\n\n  The C3 order enforces some constraints in order to be able to\n  guarantee a sensible ordering. Older versions of zope.interface did\n  not impose similar constraints, so it was possible to create\n  interfaces and declarations that are inconsistent with the C3\n  constraints. In that event, zope.interface will still produce a\n  resolution order equal to the old order, but it won't be guaranteed\n  to be fully C3 compliant. In the future, strict enforcement of C3\n  order may be the default.\n\n  A set of environment variables and module constants allows\n  controlling several aspects of this new behaviour. It is possible to\n  request warnings about inconsistent resolution orders encountered,\n  and even to forbid them. Differences between the C3 resolution order\n  and the previous order can be logged, and, in extreme cases, the\n  previous order can still be used (this ability will be removed in\n  the future). For details, see the documentation for\n  ``zope.interface.ro``.\n\n- Make inherited tagged values in interfaces respect the resolution\n  order (``__iro__``), as method and attribute lookup does. Previously\n  tagged values could give inconsistent results. See `issue 190\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/190>`_.\n\n- Add ``getDirectTaggedValue`` (and related methods) to interfaces to\n  allow accessing tagged values irrespective of inheritance. See\n  `issue 190\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/190>`_.\n\n- Ensure that ``Interface`` is always the last item in the ``__iro__``\n  and ``__sro__``. This is usually the case, but if classes that do\n  not implement any interfaces are part of a class inheritance\n  hierarchy, ``Interface`` could be assigned too high a priority.\n  See `issue 8 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/8>`_.\n\n- Implement sorting, equality, and hashing in C for ``Interface``\n  objects. In micro benchmarks, this makes those operations 40% to 80%\n  faster. This translates to a 20% speed up in querying adapters.\n\n  Note that this changes certain implementation details. In\n  particular, ``InterfaceClass`` now has a non-default metaclass, and\n  it is enforced that ``__module__`` in instances of\n  ``InterfaceClass`` is read-only.\n\n  See `PR 183 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/183>`_.\n\n\n4.7.2 (2020-03-10)\n==================\n\n- Remove deprecated use of setuptools features.  See `issue 30\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/30>`_.\n\n\n4.7.1 (2019-11-11)\n==================\n\n- Use Python 3 syntax in the documentation.  See `issue 119\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/119>`_.\n\n\n4.7.0 (2019-11-11)\n==================\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.4.\n\n- Change ``queryTaggedValue``, ``getTaggedValue``,\n  ``getTaggedValueTags`` in interfaces. They now include inherited\n  values by following ``__bases__``. See `PR 144\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/144>`_.\n\n  .. caution:: This may be a breaking change.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.8.\n\n\n4.6.0 (2018-10-23)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.7\n\n- Fix ``verifyObject`` for class objects with staticmethods on\n  Python 3. See `issue 126\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/126>`_.\n\n\n4.5.0 (2018-04-19)\n==================\n\n- Drop support for 3.3, avoid accidental dependence breakage via setup.py.\n  See `PR 110 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/110>`_.\n- Allow registering and unregistering instance methods as listeners.\n  See `issue 12 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/12>`_\n  and `PR 102 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/102>`_.\n- Synchronize and simplify zope/__init__.py. See `issue 114\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/114>`_\n\n\n4.4.3 (2017-09-22)\n==================\n\n- Avoid exceptions when the ``__annotations__`` attribute is added to\n  interface definitions with Python 3.x type hints. See `issue 98\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/98>`_.\n- Fix the possibility of a rare crash in the C extension when\n  deallocating items. See `issue 100\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/100>`_.\n\n\n4.4.2 (2017-06-14)\n==================\n\n- Fix a regression storing\n  ``zope.component.persistentregistry.PersistentRegistry`` instances.\n  See `issue 85 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/85>`_.\n\n- Fix a regression that could lead to the utility registration cache\n  of ``Components`` getting out of sync. See `issue 93\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/93>`_.\n\n4.4.1 (2017-05-13)\n==================\n\n- Simplify the caching of utility-registration data. In addition to\n  simplification, avoids spurious test failures when checking for\n  leaks in tests with persistent registries. See `pull 84\n  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/pull/84>`_.\n\n- Raise ``ValueError`` when non-text names are passed to adapter registry\n  methods:  prevents corruption of lookup caches.\n\n4.4.0 (2017-04-21)\n==================\n\n- Avoid a warning from the C compiler.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/71)\n\n- Add support for Python 3.6.\n\n4.3.3 (2016-12-13)\n==================\n\n- Correct typos and ReST formatting errors in documentation.\n\n- Add API documentation for the adapter registry.\n\n- Ensure that the ``LICENSE.txt`` file is included in built wheels.\n\n- Fix C optimizations broken on Py3k.  See the Python bug at:\n  http://bugs.python.org/issue15657\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/60)\n\n\n4.3.2 (2016-09-05)\n==================\n\n- Fix equality testing of ``implementedBy`` objects and proxies.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/55)\n\n\n4.3.1 (2016-08-31)\n==================\n\n- Support Components subclasses that are not hashable.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/53)\n\n\n4.3.0 (2016-08-31)\n==================\n\n- Add the ability to sort the objects returned by ``implementedBy``.\n  This is compatible with the way interface classes sort so they can\n  be used together in ordered containers like BTrees.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/42)\n\n- Make ``setuptools`` a hard dependency of ``setup.py``.\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/13)\n\n- Change a linear algorithm (O(n)) in ``Components.registerUtility`` and\n  ``Components.unregisterUtility`` into a dictionary lookup (O(1)) for\n  hashable components. This substantially improves the time taken to\n  manipulate utilities in large registries at the cost of some\n  additional memory usage. (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/46)\n\n\n4.2.0 (2016-06-10)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.5\n\n- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.\n\n\n4.1.3 (2015-10-05)\n==================\n\n- Fix installation without a C compiler on Python 3.5\n  (https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.interface/issues/24).\n\n\n4.1.2 (2014-12-27)\n==================\n\n- Add support for PyPy3.\n\n- Remove unittest assertions deprecated in Python3.x.\n\n- Add ``zope.interface.document.asReStructuredText``, which formats the\n  generated text for an interface using ReST double-backtick markers.\n\n\n4.1.1 (2014-03-19)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.4.\n\n\n4.1.0 (2014-02-05)\n==================\n\n- Update ``boostrap.py`` to version 2.2.\n\n- Add ``@named(name)`` declaration, that specifies the component name, so it\n  does not have to be passed in during registration.\n\n\n4.0.5 (2013-02-28)\n==================\n\n- Fix a bug where a decorated method caused false positive failures on\n  ``verifyClass()``.\n\n\n4.0.4 (2013-02-21)\n==================\n\n- Fix a bug that was revealed by porting zope.traversing. During a loop, the\n  loop body modified a weakref dict causing a ``RuntimeError`` error.\n\n4.0.3 (2012-12-31)\n==================\n\n- Fleshed out PyPI Trove classifiers.\n\n4.0.2 (2012-11-21)\n==================\n\n- Add support for Python 3.3.\n\n- Restored ability to install the package in the absence of ``setuptools``.\n\n- LP #1055223:  Fix test which depended on dictionary order and failed randomly\n  in Python 3.3.\n\n4.0.1 (2012-05-22)\n==================\n\n- Drop explicit ``DeprecationWarnings`` for \"class advice\" APIS (these\n  APIs are still deprecated under Python 2.x, and still raise an exception\n  under Python 3.x, but no longer cause a warning to be emitted under\n  Python 2.x).\n\n4.0.0 (2012-05-16)\n==================\n\n- Automated build of Sphinx HTML docs and running doctest snippets via tox.\n\n- Deprecate the \"class advice\" APIs from ``zope.interface.declarations``:\n  ``implements``, ``implementsOnly``, and ``classProvides``.  In their place,\n  prefer the equivalent class decorators: ``@implementer``,\n  ``@implementer_only``, and ``@provider``.  Code which uses the deprecated\n  APIs will not work as expected under Py3k.\n\n- Remove use of '2to3' and associated fixers when installing under Py3k.\n  The code is now in a \"compatible subset\" which supports Python 2.6, 2.7,\n  and 3.2, including PyPy 1.8 (the version compatible with the 2.7 language\n  spec).\n\n- Drop explicit support for Python 2.4 / 2.5 / 3.1.\n\n- Add support for PyPy.\n\n- Add support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.\n\n- Add 'setup.py dev' alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs\n  ``nose`` and ``coverage``).\n\n- Add 'setup.py docs' alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).\n\n- Replace all unittest coverage previously accomplished via doctests with\n  unittests.  The doctests have been moved into a ``docs`` section, managed\n  as a Sphinx collection.\n\n- LP #910987:  Ensure that the semantics of the ``lookup`` method of\n  ``zope.interface.adapter.LookupBase`` are the same in both the C and\n  Python implementations.\n\n- LP #900906:  Avoid exceptions due to tne new ``__qualname__`` attribute\n  added in Python 3.3 (see PEP 3155 for rationale).  Thanks to Antoine\n  Pitrou for the patch.\n\n3.8.0 (2011-09-22)\n==================\n\n- New module ``zope.interface.registry``.  This is code moved from\n  ``zope.component.registry`` which implements a basic nonperistent component\n  registry as ``zope.interface.registry.Components``.  This class was moved\n  from ``zope.component`` to make porting systems (such as Pyramid) that rely\n  only on a basic component registry to Python 3 possible without needing to\n  port the entirety of the ``zope.component`` package.  Backwards\n  compatibility import shims have been left behind in ``zope.component``, so\n  this change will not break any existing code.\n\n- New ``tests_require`` dependency: ``zope.event`` to test events sent by\n  Components implementation.  The ``zope.interface`` package does not have a\n  hard dependency on ``zope.event``, but if ``zope.event`` is importable, it\n  will send component registration events when methods of an instance of\n  ``zope.interface.registry.Components`` are called.\n\n- New interfaces added to support ``zope.interface.registry.Components``\n  addition: ``ComponentLookupError``, ``Invalid``, ``IObjectEvent``,\n  ``ObjectEvent``, ``IComponentLookup``, ``IRegistration``,\n  ``IUtilityRegistration``, ``IAdapterRegistration``,\n  ``ISubscriptionAdapterRegistration``, ``IHandlerRegistration``,\n  ``IRegistrationEvent``, ``RegistrationEvent``, ``IRegistered``,\n  ``Registered``, ``IUnregistered``, ``Unregistered``,\n  ``IComponentRegistry``, and ``IComponents``.\n\n- No longer Python 2.4 compatible (tested under 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2).\n\n3.7.0 (2011-08-13)\n==================\n\n- Move changes from 3.6.2 - 3.6.5 to a new 3.7.x release line.\n\n3.6.7 (2011-08-20)\n==================\n\n- Fix sporadic failures on x86-64 platforms in tests of rich comparisons\n  of interfaces.\n\n3.6.6 (2011-08-13)\n==================\n\n- LP #570942:  Now correctly compare interfaces  from different modules but\n  with the same names.\n\n  N.B.: This is a less intrusive / destabilizing fix than the one applied in\n  3.6.3:  we only fix the underlying cmp-alike function, rather than adding\n  the other \"rich comparison\" functions.\n\n- Revert to software as released with 3.6.1 for \"stable\" 3.6 release branch.\n\n3.6.5 (2011-08-11)\n==================\n\n- LP #811792:  work around buggy behavior in some subclasses of\n  ``zope.interface.interface.InterfaceClass``, which invoke ``__hash__``\n  before initializing ``__module__`` and ``__name__``.  The workaround\n  returns a fixed constant hash in such cases, and issues a ``UserWarning``.\n\n- LP #804832:  Under PyPy, ``zope.interface`` should not build its C\n  extension.  Also, prevent attempting to build it under Jython.\n\n- Add a tox.ini for easier xplatform testing.\n\n- Fix testing deprecation warnings issued when tested under Py3K.\n\n3.6.4 (2011-07-04)\n==================\n\n- LP 804951:  InterfaceClass instances were unhashable under Python 3.x.\n\n3.6.3 (2011-05-26)\n==================\n\n- LP #570942:  Now correctly compare interfaces  from different modules but\n  with the same names.\n\n3.6.2 (2011-05-17)\n==================\n\n- Moved detailed documentation out-of-line from PyPI page, linking instead to\n  http://docs.zope.org/zope.interface .\n\n- Fixes for small issues when running tests under Python 3.2 using\n  ``zope.testrunner``.\n\n- LP # 675064:  Specify return value type for C optimizations module init\n  under Python 3:  undeclared value caused warnings, and segfaults on some\n  64 bit architectures.\n\n- setup.py now raises RuntimeError if you don't have Distutils installed when\n  running under Python 3.\n\n3.6.1 (2010-05-03)\n==================\n\n- A non-ASCII character in the changelog made 3.6.0 uninstallable on\n  Python 3 systems with another default encoding than UTF-8.\n\n- Fix compiler warnings under GCC 4.3.3.\n\n3.6.0 (2010-04-29)\n==================\n\n- LP #185974:  Clear the cache used by ``Specificaton.get`` inside\n  ``Specification.changed``.  Thanks to Jacob Holm for the patch.\n\n- Add support for Python 3.1. Contributors:\n\n    Lennart Regebro\n    Martin v Loewis\n    Thomas Lotze\n    Wolfgang Schnerring\n\n  The 3.1 support is completely backwards compatible. However, the implements\n  syntax used under Python 2.X does not work under 3.X, since it depends on\n  how metaclasses are implemented and this has changed. Instead it now supports\n  a decorator syntax (also under Python 2.X)::\n\n    class Foo:\n        implements(IFoo)\n        ...\n\n  can now also be written::\n\n    @implementer(IFoo):\n    class Foo:\n        ...\n\n  There are 2to3 fixers available to do this change automatically in the\n  zope.fixers package.\n\n- Python 2.3 is no longer supported.\n\n\n3.5.4 (2009-12-23)\n==================\n\n- Use the standard Python doctest module instead of zope.testing.doctest, which\n  has been deprecated.\n\n\n3.5.3 (2009-12-08)\n==================\n\n- Fix an edge case: make providedBy() work when a class has '__provides__' in\n  its __slots__ (see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.zope.devel/22490)\n\n\n3.5.2 (2009-07-01)\n==================\n\n- BaseAdapterRegistry.unregister, unsubscribe: Remove empty portions of\n  the data structures when something is removed.  This avoids leaving\n  references to global objects (interfaces) that may be slated for\n  removal from the calling application.\n\n\n3.5.1 (2009-03-18)\n==================\n\n- verifyObject: use getattr instead of hasattr to test for object attributes\n  in order to let exceptions other than AttributeError raised by properties\n  propagate to the caller\n\n- Add Sphinx-based documentation building to the package buildout\n  configuration. Use the ``bin/docs`` command after buildout.\n\n- Improve package description a bit. Unify changelog entries formatting.\n\n- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org as\n  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.\n\n\n3.5.0 (2008-10-26)\n==================\n\n- Fix declaration of _zope_interface_coptimizations, it's not a top level\n  package.\n\n- Add a DocTestSuite for odd.py module, so their tests are run.\n\n- Allow to bootstrap on Jython.\n\n- Fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/3.3/+bug/98388: ISpecification\n  was missing a declaration for __iro__.\n\n- Add optional code optimizations support, which allows the building\n  of C code optimizations to fail (Jython).\n\n- Replace `_flatten` with a non-recursive implementation, effectively making\n  it 3x faster.\n\n\n3.4.1 (2007-10-02)\n==================\n\n- Fix a setup bug that prevented installation from source on systems\n  without setuptools.\n\n\n3.4.0 (2007-07-19)\n==================\n\n- Final release for 3.4.0.\n\n\n3.4.0b3 (2007-05-22)\n====================\n\n\n- When checking whether an object is already registered, use identity\n  comparison, to allow adding registering with picky custom comparison methods.\n\n\n3.3.0.1 (2007-01-03)\n====================\n\n- Made a reference to OverflowWarning, which disappeared in Python\n  2.5, conditional.\n\n\n3.3.0 (2007/01/03)\n==================\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Refactor the adapter-lookup algorithim to make it much simpler and faster.\n\n  Also, implement more of the adapter-lookup logic in C, making\n  debugging of application code easier, since there is less\n  infrastructre code to step through.\n\n- Treat objects without interface declarations as if they\n  declared that they provide ``zope.interface.Interface``.\n\n- Add a number of richer new adapter-registration interfaces\n  that provide greater control and introspection.\n\n- Add a new interface decorator to zope.interface that allows the\n  setting of tagged values on an interface at definition time (see\n  zope.interface.taggedValue).\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- A bug in multi-adapter lookup sometimes caused incorrect adapters to\n  be returned.\n\n\n3.2.0.2 (2006-04-15)\n====================\n\n- Fix packaging bug:  'package_dir' must be a *relative* path.\n\n\n3.2.0.1 (2006-04-14)\n====================\n\n- Packaging change:  suppress inclusion of 'setup.cfg' in 'sdist' builds.\n\n\n3.2.0 (2006-01-05)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of\n  the Zope 3.2.0 release.\n\n\n3.1.0 (2005-10-03)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of\n  the Zope 3.1.0 release.\n\n- Made attribute resolution order consistent with component lookup order,\n  i.e. new-style class MRO semantics.\n\n- Deprecate 'isImplementedBy' and 'isImplementedByInstancesOf' APIs in\n  favor of 'implementedBy' and 'providedBy'.\n\n\n3.0.1 (2005-07-27)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of\n  the Zope X3.0.1 release.\n\n- Fix a bug reported by James Knight, which caused adapter registries\n  to fail occasionally to reflect declaration changes.\n\n\n3.0.0 (2004-11-07)\n==================\n\n- Corresponds to the version of the zope.interface package shipped as part of\n  the Zope X3.0.0 release.\n"
